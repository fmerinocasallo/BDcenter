# Issues with user running Fiji

At the moment, the user running the Fiji app is neither the root nor your host user, but an ```ict2``` user without permission to write in your folders. 

You can read all images/macros and run your analysis but, if you need to save new data, it's advisable to create a new directory in your home while you are inside Fiji. In this way, all new images/macros can be saved there.
